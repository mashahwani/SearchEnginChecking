# SearchEnginChecking
This is an assignment where i made a short research to find answers of few questions.



What do you observer in the list of suggestions? Are there any pattern ?
Yes I found the searches based on a pattern. The pattern was designed based on search popularities. Whiling entering of the texts, the search engines were showing those results which were popular among people. Second pattern I found in, was of text similarities. The text I enter, the search engine was find its words separately. Google’s search results were 75 percent relevant to my search. Secondly it was Bing which show me the relevant result around 50 percent. And duck duck go’s results were less than 50 percent result relevancy.

Observe the list of search results for “introduction to text analysis” on  3 search engines Google, Duck Duck Go and Bing. Do all search engines return the same result?
No, Not at all. All the three search engines return the first two sites same. And after that there was big difference among the results of these engines.

Which of the site is listed in the top 5 results of all 3 search engines?
The site “ library.duke.edu “ was top listed in the results of these search engines.

Do you think that the order of the websites in the search results is important?
Of course it is important. The order of search result may reduce the time of a user whiling searching his/her topic. On the other hand the order creates a kind of relevancy.

Try to find which mechanism / formula/ algorithm(s) are being used to order the results?
There is a mechanism known as search engine mechanism , is used for ordering the web pages through relevancy.
